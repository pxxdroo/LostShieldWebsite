# Simple Shield Website!
This site was developed by me and some friends for the company Lost Shield, which is now called VortexiaShield. And we're not going to use it anymore, so I'm releasing it on github for obvious reasons :) I hope beginners can use it from the ground up xd

# WARN!
This site was made using the Mobirise website maker, and I also tweaked the index a little to make it more beautiful!
